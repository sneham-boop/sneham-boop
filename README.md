# Hi Y'all, I'm Sneha. 👋

I am an electrical engineer turned web-developer. Here's a few things about me that you might enjoy reading and probably never use in any real way. 😜

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything with maps or animation. I've recently spent A LOT OF TIME going through Google Maps API documentation along with the google-maps-react package and how to use all of this in a project. Hit me up if you'd like to work together on anything with routes, custom maps, marker based data, distance calculations. Also, Greensock Animation and their GSAP package has been fascinating to learn about. 
- 🔭 I’m currently working on [ParkEATs](https://parkeat.netlify.app/)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning MongoDB, to be able to use a NoSQL database for ParkEATs
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with using cloud based databases directly with frontend code. I've used Supabase's API so far and hoping to use Mongo's database API in my new project, ofCORS it might not happen as I expect. ;) Get it?
- 💬 Ask me about a list of things that bugs my dog. It's not long. But, it's surely wierd. 🧐
- 📫 How to reach me: hello@snehakm.com
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm also an artist. I add black, RIDICULOUSLY, squigly lines all over watercolour paintings. 
- 🤓 Not so fun, but still a fact: I was a research assistent for a medical image processing lab and worked on developing an algorithm for catching benign skin lesions vs not so nice ones. This is sort of where my interest in visuals and coding started to overlap. 

- 😆 Ok, last one. Although I'm more than certain that I've barely scratched the surface, this one still hit's home..
