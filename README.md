# Hi Y'all, I'm Sneha. 👋

I am an electrical engineer turned web-developer. Here's a few things about me that you will probably never use in anyway.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [ParkEATs](https://parkeat.netlify.app/)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning MongoDB, to be able to use a NoSQL database for ParkEATs
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything with maps. I've spent A LOT OF TIME going through the google-maps-react package and how to use this in a project. Hit me up if you'd like to work together on anything with routes, custom maps, marker based data, distance calculations. Also, Greensock Animation and their GSAP package has been fascinating to learn about. 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with cloud based databases. Hoping to use Mongo's database API in my new project, ofCORS it might not happen as I expect. ;) Get it?
- 💬 Ask me about how two of my house plants recently died. 🧐
- 📫 How to reach me: hello@snehakm.com
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm also an artist. I add black RIDICULOUSLY squigly lines all over watercolour paintings. 
- 😆 Although I'm more than certain that I've barely scratched the surface, this one hit's home..
